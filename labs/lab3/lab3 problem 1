1) n^3 is asymptotically larger because any value n that is larger than the constant provided will make n^3 larger than 10000000000n^2.
2) n^(2)log(n) is asymptotically larger because log rules make n(log(n))^10 become 10nlog(n), which is smaller because the power is less than N62.
3) 2^sqrt(n) is asymptotically larger because of log rules
4) 2^2n is asymptotically larger because any value n larger than 1 will make 2^2n larger than 2^n.
