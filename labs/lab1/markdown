So for me, this problem was rather difficult. I hadn't really been able to practice Java much in a while, so I sort of had to relearn it as I went through
the assignment and looked up videos to give me heavy support. I am definitely considering going through the CodeAcademy stuff again. As for Python, I've
actually never learned it before, so I have absolutely 0 experience with that language. However, I do understand why people say it's one of, if not the
easiest language to learn, as with my very small amount of coding experience, I was still able to mostly decipher what each line meant and did. 

For the assignment, I watched videos and tried out your recommended method of attempting to solve it for 30 minutes, then looking at the solution. Then,
the next day, I attempted to solve it from memory, where I was able to get down about half of it in real code, and the other half in pseudo. I will
continue to keep practicing in both languages and start studying more in my own time to get the languages down.
