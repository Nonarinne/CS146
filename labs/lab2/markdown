This assignment was pretty straightforward. The first check is whether or not the two strings inputted are of the same length, and assuming they are,
the two strings are then sorted alphabetically in a their own character arrays. After this, all that is needed is to check if the two arrays are
equal to each other. The Java side was something I was again more familiar with, but still took some time and multiple attempts. The Python side 
made my jaw drop with how streamlined and simple the code was by using the built in sorted method. Seeing how simple and nice Python is is making me 
want to learn it even more.
