For insertion sort, the worst and average case time complexity would be O(n^2), where the sorting algorithm would have to iterate through both
arrays fully/near fully because it is unsorted. The best case time complexity would be O(n), where the array is already perfectly sorted, so 
the elements would just be popped into the end point of the sorted array.
