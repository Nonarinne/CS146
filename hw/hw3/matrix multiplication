I think that this code would be worst-case O(n^3). First off, I see 3 for loops, which immediately gives me an idea of how long it MIGHT run. However, in class, you mentioned that 
you cannot simply go off of how many for loops there are because there exists exceptions, so I have to look more deeply into the code. I can see that for each element in rows_A,
there is another for loop, where for each element of cols_B, there is yet another for loop that multiplies and adds up the sums of each element from both positions of the matrices.
Because each for loop here has a worst-case runtime of O(n), you have O(n*n*n) which thus equals O(n^3).
