For insertion sort, the best-case time complexity would be O(n) because the elements would already be in order, and they are simply being added to the end, without having to interate through the
sorted array.
However, the worst-case time complexity would be O(n^2) because if the order of the elements is reversed, then the elements would need to fully iterate through the sorted array to be inserted
at the front.
