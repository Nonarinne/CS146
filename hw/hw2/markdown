This assignment took me a little while to figure out how to implement. I had the intuition mostly down, but the main issue was that LeetCode didn't provide what the 
isBadVersion API looked like, so I kinda had to figure out from different tests what it did exactly. I ended up looking it up to make sure I was on the right path
and was a bit surprised, cuz the idea I had was going to be a lot more work, where it would have iterated through the array from both sides at the same time,
whereas the code that other people use simply go one way or the other depending on what the API returned. I need to work on my coding and my intuition.
