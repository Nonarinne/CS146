For this assignment, I had actually done a palindrome problem before in one of my past CS classes in Java. Because of this, I had a little more to go off
of when working on the assignment in Java. It wasn't much, but I was able to come up with roughly half of the actual code, and the other half in pseudocode
on my first attempt. However, I'm still new to Python, so I still had to look up how to code it in that language, to which I was actually very surprised
on how simple and easy one of the methods was. I think the method I chose to type out is considered one of the less efficient methods, but I was just
amazed at how little code there was since Python provides its own methods that help in creating the code.
